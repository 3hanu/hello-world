First repository 
*Import required third party library to your Python 
IDE.  

*Get the HTML source code from the request library.
To get the source code from the web page we have to 
use request library.
We have to write a code for this.
For example - 
     source = request.get('https......com').text

* Parse the HTML file into the third party library 
and specify our parser.
For example - 
         soup = BeautifulSoup(source,'lxml')

* Now extract useful data from the HTML content. Start
by parsing out the information that we want.
